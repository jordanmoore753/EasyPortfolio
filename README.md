# EasyPortfolio

Are you a developer with an outstanding understanding of server-side programming? If so, do you also have a debilitating lack of front-end skills? Furthermore, are you on the job hunt and need a fresh, professional portfolio website to show off your programming skills?

If you meet any or all of those requirements, you may be in luck.

With **EasyPortfolio**, you can have a working portfolio for your *Ruby* projects and Resume up in minutes. I took care of the front-end work; the CSS is all mobile-first, with media queries that make viewing on any device possible.

Additionally, the tests for the views, HTML, and CSS are all included with the gem's installation.

## How To Use

Simply install the gem `easy_portfolio` and run the command `easy` from the directory where you would like your project to be stored.

Upon opening the HTML and CSS you will see that it comes with all of the layouts and styles needed. All you need to do is include pictures, load some Ruby code, write yourself a small biography, and upload your Resume. 

Of course, feel free to personalize the CSS as much as you'd like. But be wary of messing with the structure of the layout, as the tests are set up to ensure that your layout looks great on any device and the smallest change can affect the page's appearance.
